## Pupil-ROS
The objective of this ROS package is to receive the various data streamed by Pupil Core and make them available as ROS topics.

## Prerequisites
Required Hardware:
- Pupil Core

Required software:
- Ubuntu 20.04
- ROS Noetic
- [Pupil Capture](https://docs.pupil-labs.com/core/#_1-put-on-pupil-core)

Required python packages:
- zmq
- msgpack
- opencv
- numpy
- screeninfo
```
pip install pyzmq msgpack opencv-python screeninfo pygame
```
## Running 
1. Open pupil capture
2. Adjust cameras, and focus. Move your eyes around until blue circle is surrounding your eye
3. open the word camera view and press c to start the calibration. Then follow the blue/red dot with your gaze. Afterward, check the accuracy and if it is not high enough, redo the calibration. 
4. In the world camera view window, click on Plugin Manager on the right side and activate Surface Tracker. 
5. Once the QR-codes are recognized (they turn green), click on Add surface and then on the camera stream click on edit surface. Then zou can drag the red dots to the edges of the screen and click again on edit surface to save the configuration. 
6. On the Video Source menu on the right you can change the frame rate to 60 Hz. 
7. Go to the Network API menu on the right and change the frame publisher format to BGR. 
8. Go to the ros workspace, source it and run roslaunch pupil_connect pupil_stream.launch, 
9. The run roslaunch pupil_connect gaze_tracking.launch

How to enable gaze tracking:
1. go to the launch/config/pupil_topics.yaml and add gaze in the array. If you restart the pupil_stream.launch, you will then find the /pupil_gaze topic with the norm_pos which is showing the x and y positions of the gaze vector/point. 

## Setup

### Pupil Capture

### Surface Tracking
1. Activate the `Surface Tracker` plugin under the plugins menu in Pupil Capture.
2. Follow the steps listed under: https://docs.pupil-labs.com/core/software/pupil-capture/#surface-tracking

## ROS Topics
A total of 4 topics are published:
- pupil_frame
- pupil_pupil
- pupil_gaze
- pupil_surface

### pupil_frame
This topic publishes the camera data from Pupil core. Three camera feeds are streamed by Pupil Core: the world camera (front camera) and the 2 eye cameras.
Structure:
- `topic`: identifies camera feed. 
    - "frame.world": front camera
    - "frame.eye.0"/"frame.eye.1": eye cameras
- `width`: width of camera data in pixel
- `height`: height of camera data in pixel
- `format`: color format. Default: bgr
- `image`: the image data. An example on formatting image data can be found under `pupil_connect/scripts/frame_sub.py`

### pupil_pupil
This topic directly reflects the structure of the [pupil datum format](https://docs.pupil-labs.com/developer/core/overview/#pupil-datum-format).

Care must be taken in which coordinate system data is mapped in. There are 3 coordinate systems, each with different conventions:
- 2D Image Space 
    - Origin: top left
    - Unit: pixels
    - Bounds: `x: [0, <image width>], y: [0, <image height>]`
- 2D Normalized Space
    - Normalized 2D image space
    - Origin: bottom left
    - Unit: Image width/height
    - Bounds: `x: [0, 1], y: [0, 1]`
- 3D Camera Space
    - Origin: Camera center
    - Bounds: n/a

These coordinate systems apply to pupil_gaze data as well. Which coordinate system each data field uses is listed in the above link. 

More information on the coordinate systems: https://docs.pupil-labs.com/core/terminology/#coordinate-system

### pupil_gaze
This topic directly reflects the structure of the [gaze datum format](https://docs.pupil-labs.com/developer/core/overview/#gaze-datum-format). Which coordinate systems are used for each data field is listed as well.  

`base_data` is not included yet. 

TODO: is data published monocular or binocular gaze data?

### pupil_surface
This topic directly reflects the structure of the [surface datum format](https://docs.pupil-labs.com/developer/core/overview/#surface-datum-format).

Surface coordinates are normalized with respect to the identified width and height of the surface with the orgin being bottom left.
