L1
timestamp 74874.649563: I observed this a few times, if the participant fails to place the target into the goal at ocne the gaze kind of is between the middle of the next target and the current goal.
Index 38-39: target C potential outlier
Index 146-147: eventual outlier for target C

L2
Index 152-153: potentially outlier for goal D. Initial fixation start might be late due to inaccuracy
timestamp 8295.873051: instance of gaze stop between target and goal due to long distance
Index 196-197: eventually outlier for Goal D. Gaze stops midway through travel. Might it be a sign of fatigue?
Index 200-201: same as above index

R1
Index 30-31: overshoot of gaze for goal D?
Index 40-41: gaze stop midway through for goal C
Index 116-117: looks up again midway through from target C to goal C. eventual outlier

R2
Index 62-65: potential outlier. Gaze stays at target B while putting block into goal B.
Index 82-83: eventual outlier for target D. gaze stops midway. Did not include this pre-fixation
Timestamp 8572.516334: happens quite often for target and goal A. Gaze somewhere in the middle and doesn't move
Index 150-152: eventual outlier for target D. Subject checked target A before going to target D. Shorter distance traveled



Qualitative observation: gaze always moves predictively. If a block does not fit into its goal in one go, one of 3 things happens:
	1) gaze moves back to goal to place block properly
	2) gaze stops midway through moving to next target. Moves to target once block placed
	3) gaze has already moved to next target. Stays there while target is placed properly
